  --sequence            The input protein sequence can be entered directly into this
                        form. The sequence can be in FASTA or UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
                        format. A partially formatted sequence is not accepted.
                        Adding a return to the end of the sequence may help certain
                        applications understand the input. Note that directly using
                        data from word processors may yield unpredictable results as
                        hidden/control characters may be present.
