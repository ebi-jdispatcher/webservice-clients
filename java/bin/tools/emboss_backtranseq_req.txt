  --codontable          Codon usage table name.
  --sequence            One or more sequences to be translated can be entered
                        directly into this form. Sequences can be in GCG, FASTA,
                        PIR, NBRF, PHYLIP or UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot format. Partially
                        formatted sequences are not accepted. Adding a return to the
                        end of the sequence may help certain applications understand
                        the input. Note that directly using data from word
                        processors may yield unpredictable results as hidden/control
                        characters may be present.
