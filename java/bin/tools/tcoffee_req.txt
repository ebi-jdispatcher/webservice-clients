  --format              Format for generated multiple sequence alignment.
  --matrix              Matrix series to use when generating the multiple sequence
                        alignment. The program goes through the chosen matrix
                        series, spanning the full range of amino acid distances.
  --order               The order in which the sequences appear in the final
                        alignment.
  --stype               Defines the type of the sequences to be aligned.
  --sequence            Three or more sequences to be aligned can be entered
                        directly into this form. Sequences can be in GCG, FASTA,
                        EMBL (Nucleotide only), GenBank, PIR, NBRF, PHYLIP or
                        UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (Protein only) format. Partially
                        formatted sequences are not accepted. Adding a return to the
                        end of the sequence may help certain applications understand
                        the input. Note that directly using data from word
                        processors may yield unpredictable results as hidden/control
                        characters may be present. There is currently a sequence
                        input limit of 500 sequences and 1MB of data.
