--program          	command	The FASTA program to be used for the Sequence Similarity Search
--stype            	string 	Indicates if the query sequence is protein, DNA or RNA. Used to force FASTA to interpret the input sequence as specified type of sequence (via. the '-p', '-n' or '-U' options), this prevents issues when using nucleotide sequences that contain many ambiguous residues.
--matrix           	string 	(Protein searches) The substitution matrix used for scoring alignments when searching the database. Target identity is the average alignment identity the matrix would produce in the absence of homology and can be used to compare different matrix types. Alignment boundaries are more accurate when the alignment identity matches the target identity percentage.
--match_scores     	string 	(Nucleotide searches) The match score is the bonus to the alignment score when matching the same base. The mismatch is the penalty when failing to match.
--gapopen          	integer	Score for the first residue in a gap.
--gapext           	integer	Score for each additional residue in a gap.
--hsps             	boolean	Turn on/off the display of all significant alignments between query and library sequence.
--expupperlim      	double 	Limits the number of scores and alignments reported based on the expectation value. This is the maximum number of times the match is expected to occur by chance.
--explowlim        	double 	Limit the number of scores and alignments reported based on the expectation value. This is the minimum number of times the match is expected to occur by chance. This allows closely related matches to be excluded from the result in favor of more distant relationships.
--strand           	string 	For nucleotide sequences specify the sequence strand to be used for the search. By default both upper (provided) and lower (reverse complement of provided) strands are used, for single stranded sequences searching with only the upper or lower strand may provide better results.
--hist             	boolean	Turn on/off the histogram in the FASTA result. The histogram gives a qualitative view of how well the statistical theory fits the similarity scores calculated by the program.
--scores           	integer	Maximum number of match score summaries reported in the result output.
--alignments       	integer	Maximum number of match alignments reported in the result output.
--scoreformat      	string 	Different score report formats.
--stats            	string 	The statistical routines assume that the library contains a large sample of unrelated sequences. Options to select what method to use include regression, maximum likelihood estimates, shuffles, or combinations of these.
--annotfeats       	boolean	Turn on/off annotation features. Annotation features shows features from UniProtKB, such as variants, active sites, phospho-sites and binding sites that have been found in the aligned region of the database hit. To see the annotation features in the results after this has been enabled, select sequences of interest and click to 'Show' Alignments. This option also enables a new result tab (Domain Diagrams) that highlights domain regions.
--annotsym         	string 	Specify the annotation symbols.
--dbrange          	string 	Specify the sizes of the sequences in a database to search against. For example: 100-250 will search all sequences in a database with length between 100 and 250 residues, inclusive.
--seqrange         	string 	Specify a range or section of the input sequence to use in the search. Example: Specifying '34-89' in an input sequence of total length 100, will tell FASTA to only use residues 34 to 89, inclusive.
--filter           	string 	Filter regions of low sequence complexity. This can avoid issues with low complexity sequences where matches are found due to composition rather then meaningful sequence similarity. However in some cases filtering also masks regions of interest and so should be used with caution.
--transltable      	integer	Query Genetic code to use in translation
--sequence         	string 	The query sequence can be entered directly into this form. The sequence can be in GCG, FASTA, EMBL (Nucleotide only), GenBank, PIR, NBRF, PHYLIP or UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (Protein only) format. A partially formatted sequence is not accepted. Adding a return to the end of the sequence may help certain applications understand the input. Note that directly using data from word processors may yield unpredictable results as hidden/control characters may be present.
--database         	string 	The databases to run the sequence similarity search against. Multiple databases can be used at the same time
--ktup             	integer	FASTA uses a rapid word-based lookup strategy to speed the initial phase of the similarity search. The KTUP is used to control the sensitivity of the search. Lower values lead to more sensitive, but slower searches.
