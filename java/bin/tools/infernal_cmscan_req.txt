  --thresholdmodel      Model-specific reporting thresholds.
  --sequence            The input sequence can be entered directly into this form.
                        The sequence can be in GCG, FASTA, EMBL, GenBank, PIR, NBRF
                        or PHYLIP format. A partially formatted sequence is not
                        accepted. Adding a return to the end of the sequence may
                        help certain applications understand the input. Note that
                        directly using data from word processors may yield
                        unpredictable results as hidden/control characters may be
                        present.
