  --stype               Indicates if the sequences to align are protein or
                        nucleotide (DNA/RNA).
  --format              Format for generated multiple sequence alignment.
  --gapopen             The penalty for opening/closing a gap. Half the value will
                        be subtracted from the alignment score when opening, and
                        half when closing a gap.
  --gapext              Penalty for extending a gap.
  --termgap             Penalty to extend gaps from the N/C terminal of protein or
                        5'/3' terminal of nucleotide sequences.
  --bonus               A bonus score that is added to each pair of aligned residues.
  --sequence            Three or more sequences to be aligned can be entered
                        directly into this form. Sequences can be in GCG, FASTA,
                        EMBL (Nucleotide only), GenBank, PIR, NBRF, PHYLIP or
                        UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (Protein only) format. Partially
                        formatted sequences are not accepted. Adding a return to the
                        end of the sequence may help certain applications understand
                        the input. Note that directly using data from word
                        processors may yield unpredictable results as hidden/control
                        characters may be present. There is currently a sequence
                        input limit of 2000 sequences and 2MB of data.
