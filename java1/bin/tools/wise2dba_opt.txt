--para             	boolean	Show parameters in output alignmment, as in genewise.
--pretty           	boolean	Show pretty ASCII alignment viewing, as in genewise.
--asequence        	string 	The first DNA sequence to be aligned can be entered directly into the form. The sequence must be in a recognised format eg. GCG, FASTA, EMBL, GenBank. Partially formatted sequences are not accepted. Adding a return to the end of the sequence may help certain applications understand the input. Note that directly using data from word processors may yield unpredictable results as hidden/control characters may be present. There is a limit of 1MB for the sequence entry.
--bsequence        	string 	The second DNA sequence to be aligned can be entered directly into the form. The sequence must be in a recognised format eg. GCG, FASTA, EMBL, GenBank.
