--sequence         	string 	One or more sequences to be analysed can be entered directly into this form. Sequences can be in GCG, FASTA, EMBL, GenBank, PIR, NBRF or PHYLIP format. Partially formatted sequences are not accepted.
--window           	integer	The percentage CG content and the Observed frequency of CG is calculated within a window whose size is set by this parameter. The window is moved down the sequence and these statistics are calculated at each position that the window is moved to
--minlen           	integer	This sets the minimum length that a CpG island has to be before it is reported.
--minoe            	double 	This sets the minimum average observed to expected ratio of C plus G to CpG in a set of 10 windows that are required before a CpG island is reported.
--minpc            	double 	This sets the minimum average percentage of G plus C a set of 10 windows that are required before a CpG island is reported.
