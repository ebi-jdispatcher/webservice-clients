--matrix           	string 	The comparison matrix to be used to score alignments when searching the database
--gapopen          	integer	Penalty taken away from the score when a gap is created in sequence. Increasing the gap opening penalty will decrease the number of gaps in the final alignment.
--gapext           	integer	Penalty taken away from the score for each base or residue in the gap. Increasing the gap extension penalty favours short gaps in the final alignment, conversly, decreasing the gap extension penalty favours long gaps in the final alignment.
--expthr           	double 	Limits the number of scores and alignments reported based on the expectation value. This value is the maximum number of times the match is expected to occur by chance.
--mask             	boolean	Turn on/off the sequence masking for HOEs in PSSM constructions. This option allows you to mask sequence characters beyond the alignment region when constructing the PSSM, reducing over-extension errors.
--psithr           	double 	Expectation value threshold for automatic selection of matched sequences for inclusion in the PSSM at each iteration.
--scores           	integer	Maximum number of alignment score summaries reported in the result output.
--alignments       	integer	Maximum number of alignments reported in the result output.
--hsps             	boolean	Turn on/off the display of all significant alignments between query and database sequence.
--scoreformat      	string 	Different score formats.
--filter           	string 	Filter regions of low sequence complexity. This can avoid issues with low complexity sequences where matches are found due to composition rather then meaningful sequence similarity. However in some cases filtering also masks regions of interest and so should be used with caution.
--hist             	boolean	Turn on/off the histogram in the PSI-Search result. The histogram gives a qualitative view of how well the statistical theory fits the similarity scores calculated by the program.
--annotfeats       	boolean	Turn on/off annotation features. Annotation features shows features from UniProtKB, such as variants, active sites, phospho-sites and binding sites that have been found in the aligned region of the database hit. To see the annotation features in the results after this has been enabled, select sequences of interest and click to 'Show' Alignments. This option also enables a new result tab (Domain Diagrams) that highlights domain regions.
--sequence         	string 	The query sequence can be entered directly into this form. The sequence can be in GCG, FASTA, PIR, NBRF, PHYLIP or UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot format. A partially formatted sequence is not accepted. Adding a return to the end of the sequence may help certain applications understand the input. Note that directly using data from word processors may yield unpredictable results as hidden/control characters may be present.
--database         	string 	The databases to run the sequence similarity search against. Multiple databases can be selected at the same time.
--previousjobid    	string 	The job identifier for the previous PSI-Search iteration.
--selectedHits     	file   	List of identifiers from the hits of the previous iteration to use to construct the search PSSM for this iteration.
--bdrfile          	file   	Boundary file containing boundary information for pre-selected sequences.Used for hardmask to clean HOEs.
--cpfile           	file   	Checkpoint file from the previous iteration. Must be in ASN.1 Binary Format.
