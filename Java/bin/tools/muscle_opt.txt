--format           	string 	Format for generated multiple sequence alignment.
--tree             	string 	The guide tree to output
--sequence         	string 	Three or more sequences to be aligned can be entered directly into this form. Sequences can be in GCG, FASTA, EMBL (Nucleotide only), GenBank, PIR, NBRF, PHYLIP or UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (Protein only) format. Partially formatted sequences are not accepted. Adding a return to the end of the sequence may help certain applications understand the input. Note that directly using data from word processors may yield unpredictable results as hidden/control characters may be present. There is currently a sequence input limit of 500 sequences and 1MB of data.
